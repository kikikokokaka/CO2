                    <p>At the moment the earth is warming up the ice is melting and the sahara is expanding. People cannot live without a healthy earth, which provides them with fresh water, food and an enjoyable climate. Money does not have value with out an economy and people to create an economy need an earth to create it on. The earth is one of the most important gives we have received. Even though the importants the earth is not doing well and 97% of science is agreeing that human behaviour has a big influence on the current state of the earth. This is also why something has to be done to make sure future generations can live on this earth, breathing clean air, not fearing floats and having food to eat, because harvesting is still possible.</p>

                    <p>First of all, you have to make an account. Just so you know you can make the account anonymous, by using a nice nick name! After you have created an account you will have access to your private page, where you can provide the app with information concerning your CO2 influencing behaviour! No worries, you only have to answer some questions, so you are done in no time!(this behaviour can ofcourse be update, cause you will of course improve and the app will therefore also ask for a weekly update!)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="textBodyBlock">
                    <p>After you have provided the information the app calculates your current CO2 footprint and places you somewhere in the ranking.There you can compare your CO2 footprint with other people, who live in the Netherlands. Some general information concerning your living conditions and CO2 influencing behaviour is also posted there, to help you find people in similar living conditions as you are.</p>
